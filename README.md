## Description
Seahawks Win/Loss was the final project for my first computer science class. When you open the program you will be greeted with a message from Marshawn Lynch.  
Seahawks Win/Loss is written in Visual Basic and is a form that reads data from a file.  
We pre-populated that file with the scores of all the Seahawks games since signing Russell Wilson. That data is processed so that the Seahawks win %, win/loss record,  
average and total points for and points against stats can be displayed.
At the bottom of the form the user is able to add new game data and save it to the file. If an error is found for one of the games in the file the user can select that game and then has the option to modify or delete the game containing the error.
Another feature of this program is the Vs. section. On the right side of the form the user can select a team from the drop down menu and the stats of the Seahawks Vs. the selected team will be displayed.

## Usage
To use this program clone the original repository: https://github.com/daviddicken/SeahawksWinLoss.git  
Then open it up in an IDE like Visual Studio and run it.  
* If you want to edit or delete a game select the game and you have an Edit and a Delete button right under the hawks talons.  
* If you want to add a game to the file at the bottom of the app you witll find a drop down to select the date of game. Also drop downs for the home and away teams (*note:     this program is only written to track Seahawks games so one of the teams needs to be the Seahawks!*). You also have to input the score for the home team and away team then   you can click the add button to add it to the file.  
* On the right side of app you have a green dropdown menu you can use to select a team and see the stats of the Seahawks vs. that team.  
* In the bottom right hand corner of app you have a exit button that will allow you to exit the program.  
* You also have save and exit in the drop down menu under file in the top left.
